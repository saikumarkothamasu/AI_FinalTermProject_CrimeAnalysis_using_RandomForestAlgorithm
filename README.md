# AI_FinalTermProject_CrimeAnalysis_using_RandomForestAlgorithm
To build a machine learning model that can accurately predict criminal activity based on various features such as location, time, and demographics.

# Overview of Crime Analysis using Random forest Algorithm
Here we are going to predict Different types of Crime using Random forest Algorithm .Intially we collect the data and preprocess by using Numpy and pandas.We split the data by testing and training sets.we build a random forest model and we evaluate by using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.

# Random Forest Algorithm
Random forest is a machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It works by constructing a multitude of decision trees and then combining their predictions to produce a final output. In the case of crime analysis, random forest can be used to predict the likelihood of criminal activity based on various features such as location, time, and demographics.

Random forest algorithm is known for its ability to handle large datasets with high dimensionality and noisy features. It is also less prone to overfitting than other decision tree-based algorithms because of its use of random subsets of the data and features.

# Instructions to run the Project
To run the Code , you need to install Anaconda Navigator .Later you need to open jupyter notebook and Import Necessary libraries like Numpy,pandas,Seaborn,Scikit learn and import test.csv and train.csv files. By using Libraries you preprocess the data by dropping the Unnecessary libraries and select the Features and use the random forest algorithm to get the prediction values.We also calculated F1 score and recall score.Finally we save this project in rfc_predict.csv file (Here we tried to upload the file ,since github doesnt allow files more than 100 MB.)

# Note 
Git LFS is a paid feature on GitHub, and there are usage limits for free accounts. If you need to upload a large number of files or files larger than the allowed limit, you may need to upgrade to a paid plan.
